# Division by Zero Bug in C++

This repository demonstrates a common but dangerous error in C++: division by zero. The `bug.cpp` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to divide an integer by zero, which results in undefined behavior.  The program might crash, produce incorrect output, or even appear to work correctly in some cases â€“ making this error particularly insidious.

**Key Learning Points:**
* **Importance of Input Validation:**  Always validate user inputs and prevent division by zero.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage potential exceptions.
* **Undefined Behavior:** Understand that undefined behavior can lead to unpredictable program behavior.

This example highlights the need for careful coding practices to avoid common pitfalls and ensure software reliability.
